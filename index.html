            <h1>Keep Pushing!!!</h1>
                <p>You have to just keep pushing yourself harder & harder to achieve more and more. I don't think it's ever as glamorous as it appears on the outside -Sean Parker
The moment when you want to quit is the exact moment that you need to keep pushing. Because, you had a purpose before anyone had an opinion!
You have to fight through some bad days. To get to the best days of your life.
Focus, effort, success is the KEY. So keep calm and keep it pushing!!!
